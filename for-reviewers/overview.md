# Overview

## Introduction

In addition to clarifying the process for would-be applicants, this Guide also serves as a resource for reviewers. Accordingly, this section provides all reviewers with equal and open access to the tools and criteria they will need to evaluate Open Call applications, as well as the applicable Conflict of Interest Policy \(which applies to all reviewers\).

Consistent with our [**Principles & values**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/principles-values) ****\(specifically our commitment to act transparently and openly share all possible aspects of our work\), we have compiled this information in a public manner. In addition to serving as a resource for reviewers, it is our hope that this section of the Guide will also be useful for applicants. By enabling applicants to view the criteria that reviewers will use when evaluating applications, we believe applicants will be able to strengthen and submit even more competitive applications.

Covered topics include:
