# Reviewer Commitments

## Overview

When joining our team, reviewers commit to follow Reset's Conflict of Interest and Non-Disclosure policies. Together, these two policies help ensure that the review process remains unbiased and that applicants continue to trust Reset with non-public, proprietary, or confidential information.

## Conflict of Interest Policy

### What we ask

Reviewers commit to disclose any financial interest or fiduciary relationship with the applicants or organisations applicants may be affiliated with – this includes, but is not limited to, the receipt or holding of honoraria; educational grants; membership; employment; consultancies; stock ownership or other equity interests; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements.

Personal or professional relationships with applicants or organisations applicants you may be affiliated with which are non-financial and non-fiduciary in nature do not need to be disclosed. If you are unsure of the nature of your relationship with an applicant or organisation an applicant is affiliated with, you commit to disclose.

### Why we ask

Due to the nature and size of the niche, civil society space that Reset operates in, we understand that personal and professional relationships between applicants and reviewers are common. For this reason, this Conflict of Interest Policy is focused on excluding reviewers where relationships with applicants are financial and/or fiduciary in nature – that is, where delivering a positive review could result in material gain from the applicant for the reviewer.

Reset awards support to applicants based on an application’s merit and the alignment of the applicant’s projects and ideas with the purpose and goals of the Open Call responded to. Reset has established a Conflict of Interest Policy in order to ensure grants are awarded on this basis and that accordingly, the review process remains unbiased.

### What will happen

To action this, for each application, we require each reviewer to disclose details of existing relationships with any applicants, individuals, or organisations presented in the application. In order to preserve the integrity of the review process, where a reviewer has a financial interest or fiduciary relationship with an applicant or organisation the applicant is affiliated with, Reset will, following an investigation where required and at its discretion, disqualify the reviewer from reviewing the application. 

## Non-Disclosure Policy

### What we ask

Reviewers commit not to disclose any of the non-public, proprietary, or confidential information contained within an application, whether or not labeled as such, without prior written consent from Reset. If disclosure of application information will occur, reviewers commit to notify Reset and the applicant at least 30 days in advance. If disclosure of application information has occurred without notice, reviewers commit to notifying Reset and the applicant as soon as they realize a disclosure has been made.

### Why we ask

Reset wants applicants to trust us and our reviewers with non-public, proprietary, or confidential information. We understand the importance and utility of keeping some objectives non-public for the sake of accomplishing bigger goals. We also believe responsible knowledge sharing increases the efficacy of those working towards shared aims. We very much hope the application information shared with reviewers who are serving the public interest \(journalists, government officials, policy makers, etc.\) will augment their own work and in the process, advance the shared aims of applicants, reviewers, and Reset. We also understand that for these people, signing a standard non-disclosure agreement may compromise their integrity and ability to serve the public interest. What we ask for and how is an attempt to balance these needs.

### What will happen

To action this, for each application, we require that all reviewers affirm their agreement to this commitment. In order to preserve the an applicants' trust in Reset and the integrity of the review process, where a reviewer has been found disclosing application information outside of the public interest and against this policy, Reset will, following an investigation where required at our discretion, remove the reviewers access to application information, remove any publicly stated affiliation we may have, and apologize to affected applicants.
