# Conflict of Interest Policy for Reviewers

Reset awards grants to applicants based on an application’s merit and the alignment of the applicant’s projects and ideas with the purpose and goals of the Open Call responded to. Reset has established this Conflict of Interest Policy in order to ensure grants are awarded on this basis and that accordingly, the grant review process remains unbiased. To action this we require that all grant reviewers disclose details of existing relationships with applicants or organisations the applicants are affiliated with. In order to preserve the integrity of the review process, where a reviewer has a financial interest or fiduciary relationship with an applicant or organisation the applicant is affiliated with, Reset will, following investigation where required and at its discretion, disqualify the reviewer from reviewing the application. Due to the nature and size of the niche, civil society space that Reset operates in, we understand that personal and professional relationships between applicants and reviewers are common. For this reason, this Conflict of Interest Policy is focused on excluding reviewers where relationships with applicants are financial and/or fiduciary in nature – that is, where delivering a positive review could result in material gain from the applicant for the reviewer.
