# Communications & engagement

## Mailing lists

### Reset-Talk

This is a private moderate traffic list including past and current Reset supported projects, fellows, NIC members, and other key at-large folks from the internet freedom community who’ve opt’d in to join this list. Reset and many current projects provide monthly updates on this list. This is a great space to engage with projects and community members outside regular NIC tasks. If you are a reviewer and not on this list, contact a Reset team member and we’ll get you signed up.

### NIC-Talk

This is private low traffic list for past and current NIC members only. Members and Reset may bring up broader strategic topics for discussion. Reset also sends the summary of application rounds and invitations for periodic NIC calls to this list

### NIC-Review

This is a private low traffic list for currently active NIC members and review related discussions. At the start of each month, Reset will send out a tranche of applications for review with summaries as and the final determination for any past applications. NIC members should feel free to openly discussion any matters related to applications they see fit.

### Reset-Summit

This list is and invite-only list for all those attending Reset's Annual Summit which includes past and current projects and fellows, Lab service providers, NIC members and invited guests from the larger Internet freedom community.

### Reset-Announce

This is an open to the public announce only list for both Reset and other funder opportunities that we curate and send out on a regular basis. Please visit ​this link if you’d like to sign up.

### Reset Daily Newsletter

This is a daily email open to the public with Reset-curated news related to internet freedom. You can sign up from the form on the bottom of ​our main website.​ You can also follow our ​tweets​, if you don’t want to wait for the email.

## Individual emails

NIC members are a part of review groups for the fund and fellowships they’ve signed up for. When an application moves into the council review state, the application system will send reviewers individual emails letting them know there is a new application for them to review.

Every now and then, a Reset team member may email a selection of NIC members to review applications that have languished past review deadlines or that need to be expedited.

## NIC Calls

Reset hosts three NIC calls a year, within the third week of weeks of January, May, and September. These months were chosen to coincide with our every other month rounds, so that we have a call every other round. The calls will be facilitated by Reset's Executive Director, these calls will be an opportunity for all NIC members to ask any and all questions, offer advice outside of individuals reviews, discuss strategic or tactical topics of interest to NIC members, Reset, and/r the internet freedom field more generally. This will also serve as an opportunity for Reset team members to update council members on strategy and new initiatives and provide higher-level overviews of recent rounds and projects. We will be reaching out to the council list before each call to solicit topics for the agenda. Call notes will be recorded by Reset and sent out to the NIC-Talk list for all members to review and discuss as needed.

## Annual Summit

Every year \(global conditions permitting\) we plan to gather all of our active projects and fellows, service partners, NIC members, key stakeholders, and other established community members for the Reset Annual Summit. This is an invite-only event that moves around the world every year or two. All NIC members who are actively reviewing are invited to attend \(and have the cost of their travel covered by Reset\).
