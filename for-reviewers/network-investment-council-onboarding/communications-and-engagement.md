# Communications & engagement

## Mailing lists

### Reset-Talk

This is a private, moderate-traffic list for past and current Reset-supported projects, fellows, NIC members, and other key at-large folks from the internet freedom community who have opted in to join the list. Reset and many current projects provide monthly updates on this list. For those interested, this is a great space to engage with projects and community members outside of the regular NIC tasks. If you are a reviewer and not on this list, contact a Reset team member to get signed up.

### NIC-Talk

This is private, low-traffic list for past and current NIC members only. Through the list, NIC members and Reset can bring up broader strategic topics for discussion. Reset also sends out to this list the summary of application rounds and invitations for periodic NIC Calls.

### NIC-Review

This is a private, low-traffic list for currently active NIC members and review-related discussions. At the start of each month, Reset will send out a tranche of applications for review with summaries, as well as the final determination for prior applications. Through this list, NIC members \(as they see fit\) should feel free to openly discuss any matters related to applications.

### Reset-Summit

This is an invite-only list for all those attending Reset's Annual Summit, which includes past and current projects and fellows, service providers, NIC members, and invited guests from the larger Internet freedom community.

### Reset-Announce

This is an open-to-the-public, announce-only list for both Reset and other funder opportunities that we curate and send out on a regular basis. 

### Reset Newsletter

This is a periodic email open to the public with Reset-curated news related to internet freedom. You can also follow our ​[**tweets**](https://twitter.com/resetdottech)​ to stay current on Reset-related news.

## Individual emails

NIC members automatically become part of a group for the fund and fellowships they have signed up to help review. When an application moves into the NIC review process, the application system will send reviewers individual emails letting reviewers know there is a new application for them to review.

Every now and then, a Reset team member may also email a selection of NIC members to review applications that have languished past review deadlines or that need to be expedited.

## NIC Calls

Reset hosts three NIC Calls a year, within the third week of weeks of January, May, and September. These months were chosen to coincide with our every other month rounds, so that we have a call every other round. NIC Calls are facilitated by Reset's Executive Director, and serve as an opportunity for NIC members to ask questions, offer advice outside of individuals reviews, and discuss strategic or tactical topics of interest to NIC members, Reset, the general internet freedom field. These calls also serve as an opportunity for Reset team members to update NIC members on strategy and new initiatives, and provide high-level overviews of recent rounds and projects. Prior to each call, we will  reach out to the NIC-Talk list to solicit topics for the agenda. Call notes will be recorded by Reset and sent out to the NIC-Talk list for all members to review and discuss as needed.

## Annual Summit

Every year \(global conditions permitting\) we plan to gather all of our active projects and fellows, service partners, NIC members, key stakeholders, and other established community members for the Reset Annual Summit. This is an invite-only event that moves around the world every year or two. All NIC members who are actively reviewing are invited to attend \(and have the cost of their travel covered by Reset\).
