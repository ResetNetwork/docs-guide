# Communications & engagement

## Mailing lists

### Rst-Talk

This is a private, moderate-traffic list for past and current Reset-supported projects, fellows, all Council members, and other key at-large folks within communities and networks who have opted in to join the list. Reset and many current projects provide monthly updates on this list. For those interested, this is a great space to engage with projects and community members outside of the regular NIC tasks. If you are a reviewer and not on this list, contact a Reset team member to get signed up.

### Rst-Council

This is private, moderate-traffic list for all past and current Council members to discuss broader strategic topics related to Reset's work. Reset sends out to this list the summary of application rounds and invitations for periodic all Council gatherings. 

### Rst-NIC

This is private, low-traffic list for NIC members only for review-related discussions and broader strategic topics related to NIC role. Typically every couple months, Reset will send out a tranche of applications for review with summaries, as well as the final determination for prior applications. Through this list, NIC members \(as they see fit\) should feel free to openly discuss any matters related to applications.

### Rst-TX

This is a low-traffic open-to-the-public and available for all applicants announce-only list for both Reset and other funder opportunities that we curate and send out periodically. 

### Reset Newsletter

Coming soon. This will be a periodic email open to the public with Reset-curated news related to internet freedom. You can also follow our ​[**tweets**](https://twitter.com/resetdottech)​ to stay current on Reset-related news.

## Individual emails

NIC members automatically assigned access to all finalist applications in our application system. When an application moves into the NIC review process stage, the application system will send reviewers individual emails letting reviewers know there is a new application for them to review.

Every now and then, a Reset team member may also email a selection of NIC members to review applications that have languished past review deadlines or that need to be expedited.

## NIC Calls

Reset hosts three NIC Calls a year, within the third week of weeks of January, May, and September. These months were chosen to coincide with our every other month rounds, so that we have a call every other round. NIC Calls are facilitated by the Reset team and serve as an opportunity for NIC members to ask questions, offer advice outside of individuals reviews, and discuss strategic or tactical topics of interest to NIC members, Reset, the general internet freedom field. These calls also serve as an opportunity for Reset team members to update NIC members on strategy and new initiatives, and provide high-level overviews of recent rounds and projects. Prior to each call, we will  reach out to the NIC-Talk list to solicit topics for the agenda. Call notes will be recorded by Reset and sent out to the NIC-Talk list for all members to review and discuss as needed.

## Annual gathering

Every year \(global conditions permitting\) we plan to invite all of our active projects and fellows, service partners, NIC members, key stakeholders, and other established community members to a Reset annual gathering. This is an invite-only event that moves around the world every year or two. All NIC members who are actively reviewing are invited to attend \(and have the cost of their travel covered by Reset\).
