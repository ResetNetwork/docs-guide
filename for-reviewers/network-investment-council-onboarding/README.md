# Network Investment Council Onboarding

## Welcome

Thank you for being a part of the Reset [**Network Investment Council**](https://www.reset.tech/people/#network-investment-council) ****\(NIC\)! As an NIC member, you are an essential part of our Open Call application review process. We are excited to have with us and could not do what we do without your participation. You are a necessary check on our decision making process, an augmentation to our collective knowledge, and a trusted liaison within the shared networks and communities we engage together. The work you perform helps shape Reset.

We depend on you as an external and independent group of individuals to help ground and reinforce our commitment to openness and non-competitive practices. The information and guidance we receive from outside experts like you continues to raise vital considerations -- often for the first time -- during our decision-making process. Through the trust you have in your own communities and the trust you have in Reset, you bring an important anchor of accountability to our shared work. As an ambassador of Reset in those communities, you have the power to introduce Reset -- and vice versa -- to otherwise unreachable projects, fellows, or new initiatives.

The benefit is felt most by the applicants and those most affected by the harms. We consider it an honor and a primary role of ours to pass on what you give us to them. Time and time again, we hear from applicants how valuable the feedback is from Open Calls. We hear this equally from applicants who were dismissed and approved. And we see the results with better first-time and new applications from people and places that surprise us. In return, we hope that you also gain valuable insights on emerging solutions to tough and interesting challenges that align with your own interests.

Once again, thank you!
