# Network Investment Council Onboarding

## Welcome

Thank you for being a part of the Reset [**Network Investment Council**](https://www.reset.tech/people/#network-investment-council) ****\(NIC\)! As an NIC member, you are an essential part of our Open Call application review process. We are thrilled to have you working with us and simply could not do what we do without your participation. You are a necessary check on our decision-making process, an augmentation to our collective knowledge, and a trusted liaison within the networks and communities we share. The work you perform truly helps shape Reset.

As an external and independent group of individuals, we depend on you to help ground and reinforce our commitment to openness and non-competitive practices. The information and guidance we receive from outside experts like you continues to raise vital considerations - often for the first time - during our decision-making process. Through the trust you have in your own communities, and the trust you have in Reset, you bring an important anchor of accountability to our shared work. As an ambassador of Reset in those communities, you have the power to introduce Reset - and vice versa - to otherwise unreachable projects, fellows, or new initiatives.

The benefit of your work is felt most significantly by the applicants and those affected by the harms Reset is working to overcome. Time and time again, Open Call applicants tell us about the incredible value they found in your feedback. We hear this both from applicants who were dismissed and those that were successful. And we see similar results with better first-time and new applications from people and places that surprise us. In return, we hope that you also gain valuable insights on emerging solutions to tough and interesting challenges that align with your own interests.

So, once again, thank you!
