# Representing Reset

Reset depends on NIC members to help ground and reinforce our commitment to openness and non-competitive practices. Through the trust you have in your own communities and the trust you have in Reset, you bring an important anchor of accountability to our shared work. As an ambassador of Reset in those communities, you have the power to introduce Reset -- and vice versa -- to otherwise unreachable projects, fellows, or new initiatives. In return, we hope that you also gain valuable insights on emerging solutions to tough and interesting challenges that align with your own interests.
