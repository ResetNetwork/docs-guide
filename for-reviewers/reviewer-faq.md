# Reviewer FAQ

## What if I don’t feel as though I have the necessary expertise \(or feel comfortable\) to review a specific application?

That’s OK, you’re not alone. Everyday the Reset team reviews applications that any one of us alone does not have much knowledge about. In those cases, there are usually non-technical but equally important factors you may be able to weigh in on. 

For example: Do the output costs seem reasonable? Is the timeframe appropriate? Do the listed organisations and individuals seem capable of completing the proposed work? Does it seem like the applicants are, or will be, collaborating with others? Do the applicants point to existing efforts or complementary projects? 

From a more general perspective: Does the narrative tie nicely to the objects and work sections? Is the overall proposal well written? 

_**Note:**_ You may also have thoughts regarding the non-technical aspects of the application, such as the socio-political or other implications of the project. Please include these important observations, even if the form fields don’t appear to specifically allow for them. If you this occurs, please let us know how we can change the review forms to be more inclusive.
