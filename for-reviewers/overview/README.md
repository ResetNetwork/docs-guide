# Review Process Overview

## Inside this section

This section will grow to provide reviewers with access to the tools and criteria they will need to evaluate Open Call applications, as well as the applicable Conflict of Interest Policy \(which applies to all reviewers\). Consistent with our [**Principles & values**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/principles-values) ****\(specifically our commitment to act transparently and openly share all possible aspects of our work\), we have compiled this information in a public manner. In addition to serving as a resource for reviewers, it is our hope that this section of the Guide will also be useful for applicants. By enabling applicants to view the criteria that reviewers will use when evaluating applications, we believe applicants will be able to strengthen and submit even more competitive applications.

This public document is meant to offer basic information to help Reset [**Network Investment Council**](https://www.reset.tech/people/#network-investment-council) ****members, applicants, and the general public understand the role they play for Reset. 

Covered topics include:

* \*\*\*\*[**General application considerations**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/general-application-considerations)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Reviewer Commitments**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/reviewer-commitments)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Evaluation Worksheet**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/evaluation-worksheet)\*\*\*\*
