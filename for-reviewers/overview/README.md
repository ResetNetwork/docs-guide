# Overview

## Introduction

Thank you for being apart of the the Reset Network Investment Council \(NIC\), being a crucial part of our application review process, and shaping Reset through this work. We are excited you have with us and could not do what we do with your participation. While the role is voluntary, the council plays a critical role for Reset. You are a necessary check on our decision making process, an augmentation to our collective knowledge, and a trusted liaison within the shared networks and communities we engage together. 

We depend on you being an external and independent set of individuals as a primary grounding for our commitment of openness and non-competitive practices. The information and guidance we receive from outside experts like you in this role continues to raise vital considerations -- often for the first time -- during our decision making process. Through the trust you have in your own communities and the trust you have in Reset, you bring an important anchor of accountability to our shared work. As an ambassador of Reset in those communities with the power to interconnect, you introduce Reset -- and vice versa -- to otherwise unreachable projects, fellows, or new initiatives to consider advancing.

The benefit is felt most by the applicants and those most affected by the harms. We consider it an honor and a primary role of ours to pass on what you give us to them. Time and time again, we hear from applicants how valuable the feedback is from open calls. We hear this equally from applicants who were dismissed and approved. We see the results with better first-time and new applications from people and places that surprise us. In return, we hope that you gain valuable insights on emerging solutions to tough and interesting challenges that align with your own interests.

### Inside this section

This section will grow to provide reviewers with access to the tools and criteria they will need to evaluate Open Call applications, as well as the applicable Conflict of Interest Policy \(which applies to all reviewers\). Consistent with our [**Principles & values**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/principles-values) ****\(specifically our commitment to act transparently and openly share all possible aspects of our work\), we have compiled this information in a public manner. In addition to serving as a resource for reviewers, it is our hope that this section of the Guide will also be useful for applicants. By enabling applicants to view the criteria that reviewers will use when evaluating applications, we believe applicants will be able to strengthen and submit even more competitive applications.

This public document is meant to offer basic information to help AC members, applicants, and the general public understand the role they play for Reset. We recognize this document could be improved and encourage you to leave comments that will help us do so.
