# Reviewing Applications

Our approach to [**Open Calls**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls) gives us the ability to make a wide range of non-profit and for-profit investments in the organisations and people working on projects that align with our [**Goals & objectives**](../../introduction/goals-objectives.md). Each awarded project will operate in one or more of the [**Areas of work**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/goals-objectives#areas-of-work) that we support and further support and reinforce our [**Principles & values**](https://app.gitbook.com/@resetnetwork/s/guide/~/drafts/-MEUvywkmho7U8UoyC9g/introduction/principles-values) by addressing either the perils posed by [**Our vision's most pressing threat**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/how-we-see-the-world#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) \(surveillance capitalism\) or one of the [**Other harms, challenges, & obstacles**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/how-we-see-the-world#other-harms-challenges-and-obstacles) ****outlined in this Guide.
