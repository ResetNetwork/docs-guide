# Application system

The Reset Open Call application system can be found at [**https://apply.reset.tech/login/**](https://apply.reset.tech/login/). All reviewers have been provided a login for use. 

Once logged in, the best place to start is your workbench. From the workbench, you can find all the applications available for your review \(those that are listed in the state of “External review”\). You can also search for any applications that have ever been in this state before, regardless of final outcome \(approved or dismissed\). NIC member accounts have access to most data related to an application, including: reviews by the Reset team, the determination messages Reset sends applicants as formal feedback \(either requesting further information, dismissing, or approving their application\), the final determination, and any applicant responses to Reset feedback. We encourage you to explore these materials to better understand the issues previously raised by the Reset team during the course of our review.

The proposals currently under "External review" can be found on your workbench. NIC members complete the same proposal review form as Reset team members. To ensure public transparency, the text of the Evaluation worksheet can be found [**here**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/reviewing-applications/evaluation-worksheet). Text boxes allow reviewers to offer additional thoughts on any question/category. We encourage NIC members to include substantive feedback, both positive and negative.

_**Note:**_ If your login does not work, if you experience a bug or have a feature request, or if you otherwise would like to raise an issue with the application system, you can either \(a\) email the person you engage with most at Reset, \(b\) email [**hello@reset.tech**](mailto://hello@reset.tech), \(c\) start a discussion thread on the Rst-NIC mailing list, or \(d\) create an issue on our ​Github page​.
