# Decision process

Our [open calls](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls) provide people and organizations an always open door for us to learn about their work that aligns with our [goals & objectives](../introduction/goals-objectives.md), are the [types of work](../introduction/goals-objectives.md#type-of-work) we care most about, and support our [principles & values](../introduction/principles-values.md).

We always aim to be transparent about how we invest, so we’ve outlined the eight stages we typically follow below. These will change and we want your [feedback](../give-us-feedback.md) as we are constantly looking for ways to improve our process.

## When to Apply

Applications for all our Open Calls are accepted on a rolling basis. There will always be at least one open call that is always open. You can submit at any time throughout the year, with “round” deadlines every other month. Round deadlines occur on January 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, September 1, and November 1. Applications must be submitted no later than 23:59 \(11:59PM\) GMT on the date of the deadline in order to be considered as part of that round.  If a submission is received after that time, it will be reviewed in the next round. Reset reviews applications at the end of each round.

## Stages

1. **You apply:** It begins with you.
2. **Team review:** We review your application.
3. **Initial determination:** We will have questions.
4. **Additional information:** You have the answers.
5. **Review panel:** We get other's thoughts.
6. **Final approval:** All final decisions made.
7. **Legal review:** Agreements and lawyers.
8. **Oversight:** What happens after approval.

### You apply

The process begins as soon as you submit an application.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2" %}
### Team review

After the application round deadline has passed, we will begin our internal review process.

We conduct an assessment of the application. This may include speaking to partners, other investors or funders, staff, and any other relevant third parties. Depending on the amount of applications we receive, this can take 2 or 3 weeks or 2 months. As we get through your application, our submission system and let you know our initial determination.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3" %}
### Initial determination

Once we have had a chance to review your application, we will come to our initial determination.

If we decline your application, we will provide you with feedback on why your application was not considered to move forward. We very much encourage people to use this feedback to re-apply with a stronger application.

If we are continuing to consider your application, you will receive an initial determination message from our submission system with next steps for us to gather additional information from you. In limited cases, we may ask narrow clarifying questions to make our initial determination.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="4" %}
### Additional information

At this stage, we will need more information. The scope, risk, and amount requested in the application will determine how much or how little additional information is required. We may ask you to participate on a audio/video conversation for us to learn more, submit further information or even a complete another application for due diligence purposes. We will specify a date by which you will be expected to respond.

You can expect us to have follow-up questions or comments to solicit additional clarifying information; we do this for just about all of the projects we end up supporting. Ideal applicants are specific and cost-conscious in these areas, while drilling down on details that will help make your big-picture idea come to life.

Once we our questions have been addressed, we will make another determination. Again, if we decline your application, we will provide you with feedback on why your concept was not considered to move forward. We very much encourage people to use this feedback to re-apply with a stronger application. If we continue to consider your application, at this stage we will present your application to our review panel for their thoughts.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="5" %}
### Review panel

Our review panels are made up of a diverse array of subject matter experts who understand various relevant fields and issues as they relate to our goals and objectives. They are subject matter experts who have a vested interest in Reset funding decisions and are uniquely positioned to bolster our project oversight capacity, expertise, perspective, and accountability. At least two reviews from Advisory Council members are required before an application can move forward. 

Once we have reviews from the panel, we will make another determination. Again, if we decline your application, we will provide you with feedback on why your concept was not considered to move forward. We very much encourage people to use this feedback to re-apply with a stronger application. If we continue to consider your application, at this stage your application moves on to final approval.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="6" %}
### Final approval

Before formal approval of your application, we will consult our finance and legal teams, as well as any other relevant experts, and depending on the amount and risk, we may also consult our steering committee. For-profit investments often require more extensive structuring discussions at this stage, which may be an iterative process.

Upon completion of this stage, we will inform you whether your application has been accepted or declined and why.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="7" %}
### Legal review

* The performance-based contract or funding agreement, as applicable, is drafted by our legal team
* The performance-based contract or funding agreement, as applicable, is sent for your review and signature
* Project can begin

Once we have finalized approvals and the terms of the contract or funding agreement, including agreeing structure and reporting requirements with the organisation, documentation will be drafted by our legal team and, if necessary, external counsel. It will then be sent for review and signature – and the project can begin.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="8" %}
### Oversight

Once the project begins, we look forward to working closely with the organization or individual to providing ongoing support. A Reset team member will be assigned to assist you for the duration of your work with us. We encourage open communication, will schedule regular catch-ups, and agree on a regular reporting structure.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



**Just a quick note:** Approval is not guaranteed at any stage of the process. If the opportunity is not approved, we will always explain why and provide clear and constructive feedback.
