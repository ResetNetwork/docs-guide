# Applicant Overview

## Introduction

Now that you know why we're holding Open Calls and what we hope they will accomplish, this section of the Guide provides details about the application process. The pages that follow provide all applicants with equal and open access to the tools and information they will need to prepare and submit a timely and competitive Open Call application. 

Covered topics include:

* \*\*\*\*[**Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQs\)**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/faq)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Decision Process**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/decision-process)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Application Guidelines**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/fund-guidelines)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Topical Guidance**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/topical-guidance)\*\*\*\*

_**Note:**_ ****Would-be applicants should also take the time to read the section of the Guide designed [**For Reviewers**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/overview)**.** In that section interested applicants can view the [**Evaluation Worksheet**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/evaluation-worksheet) and [**General Application Considerations**](https://guide.reset.tech/for-reviewers/general-application-considerations) that reviewers use when evaluating applications. By enabling applicants to view the criteria that reviewers will use, we believe applicants will be able to strengthen and submit even more competitive applications.
