## Priorities

What must be true is that you and/or your organisation have an understanding of the challenges of [surveillance capitalism](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) within affected societies, a passion to see harms end, an idea or vision of your and/or your organisation’s role towards ending it, how Reset augments that vision, a clear way to disseminate the outcomes broadly, and excitement to be a part of the effort.

We seek proposals from all around the world, with a priority for interventions and projects that will have the greatest global-effect. Of utmost priority, are projects that clearly complement one or more efforts to positively shift policy, market, social norms, or other technical outcomes.

Everything Reset supports must be a clear attempt to advance our _Goals_, conduct activities within one or more [_Types of Work_](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/goals-objectives#types-of-work), focus on a one or more of the already known _Harms or Challenges_ \(or teach us about a new one\), and meet any required criteria laid out below or specific to a particular open call. Generally speaking, the first item listed in our goals and types of work we support are the most important to us.

## **Review panel & process** 

For all Reset Open Calls, completing the application form is always the first step in the process. All applications will be reviewed by the Reset team. Selected applications may be invited to submit additional information. Finalists are reviewed by an independent panel of experts, for example from our Advisory Council or partner organisations, with deep knowledge and insight into topics related to our goals. Approval is not guaranteed at any stage of the application process. For more details, please review [Our Guide to Open Calls](https://guide.reset.tech/decision-process).

## Application deadlines

Applications for all our Open Calls are accepted on a rolling basis. You can submit at any time throughout the year, with “round” deadlines every other month. Round deadlines occur on January 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, September 1, and November 1. Applications must be submitted no later than 23:59 \(11:59PM\) GMT on the date of the deadline in order to be considered as part of that round. If a submission is received after that time, it will be reviewed in the next round. Reset reviews applications at the end of each round.

To stay up to date on any changes to the Open Calls and other Reset funding opportunities, sign up to join the [Reset announcements](https://hello.reset.tech/announce).

## Eligibility 

Reset does not have any requirements regarding an applicant’s status - whether for-profit, nonprofit, or a single individual, so long as the proposed effort fits within the aims of our Open Call, goals, and focus areas, it may be considered. A consortia of multiple people or organisations with one individual or organisation designated as the lead applicant are all welcome to apply. Applicants may be located in or organized under the laws of any country, except for any country on which the United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union has imposed trade restrictions or export sanctions.

## Restrictions

Applicants must not provide any type of support for any member, affiliate or representative of a designated terrorist organisation, whether or not elected members of the government.

## Areas of work

Ideal applications will fit within one of these four types of work:

* **Policy & Advocacy:** Develop and advance a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies, ensuring they better serve democracy.
* **Research:** Study the ways technology is harming democracy, how this can be reversed by creating better technology, and how to design effective legal and regulatory systems.
* **Technology:** Design and implement both existing and new tools that support in-depth research, activist engagement, and educational insights into surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and viable virtuous alternatives to the dominant exploitative platforms.
* **Civic engagement:** Educate the public about the problems caused by digital threats to democracy and the subversion of the internet.

## Ideal applicants

Our Open Calls are a competitive process with publicly available open applications. The number of applications approved for funding from a round of Open Calls vary depending on the quality of applications, our capacity, and priorities.

Applicant criteria varies per Open Call and specific criteria may be found in each Open Call description. In general, we are purposefully looking for a diverse mix of partner organisations and individuals.  We are particularly keen to receive applications from individuals, or from organizations with key team members that will be working on the project, who consider themselves under-represented within the communities and fields affected by or responding to surveillance capitalism.

We strongly encourage applications from computer scientists, human rights scholars, human-computer interaction researchers, anthropologists, ethnographers, statisticians, and mathematicians who are seeking to apply their scientific and technical skills to social problems, and from organizations with such individuals as key team members that will be working on the project. We also welcome general technologists, software developers, engineers, information security researchers, data scientists, data visualisation experts, digital rights defenders, designers, lawyers, researchers, community organisers, social scientists, artists, advocates and activists, educators, journalists, entrepreneurs, industry actors, policy analysts, public intellectuals, those who recently served in a government office or position, those whose practice doesn’t fit squarely into conventional categories, and all others as individual applicants and key team members on an organization’s project.

We encourage individual applications from independent scholars and individuals employed by universities, civil society organisations, and corporations, including those on sabbatical.  We are disciplinary agnostic and welcome people from critical, empirical, technical, legal, and humanistic fields.

In a bid to empower a new pool of talent, Reset will prioritise projects coming from individuals or organisations who are new to the digital rights community, identify as under-represented within related fields, and are requesting less than $300,000 for efforts within a 12-month duration or less.

Applicants already receiving support or known to other [Omidyar Group](https://www.omidyargroup.com/organizations/) organisations are eligible for Open Call awards. That said, applicants new to us will generally be considered [more competitive](https://guide.reset.tech/faq#what-do-we-mean-when-we-say-an-application-is-in-or-out-of-scope-and-competitive-or-not).

## Target beneficiaries

We are interested to find out who you are most concerned with helping. The options we present may be many but not exhaustive. Resist the temptation to select all that might apply. We are most interested in your top priorities, the ones you know apply.

What about our priorities? We are most interested in efforts leading to better policy in places where the positive effects will be felt by more people than those within the country where the policy was set. The global affect EU's General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) is an example. A good application does not have to be directly engaging in policy & advocacy as a type of work but it does need to clearly show how the outcomes for the selected beneficiaries will result in outcomes that will or could lead to policy change. For example, the countless research and technology projects demonstrating the myriad misuse of data justifying the need for GDPR would have been in scope \(and still are for enforcement or to point out limitations for future policy\). 

Work with outcomes focused to intervene or affect policy in the EU, US, or the UK are clear priorities. You should apply even if you do not identify your work as focused in these regions, especially if you are convinced the work will have wide effects. For example, we see opportunity for litigation in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to advance policy throughout Latin American or Australian policy change to have effects throughout Oceania and East Asia.

When in doubt, apply.

## **Commitment to diversity**

Reset seeks to embed diversity, equity and inclusion \(DEI\) into our work. We are committed to providing equal opportunity and an environment free of discrimination. For Open Calls, this means we will consider all applications equally, without regard to race, creed, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin or ancestry, alienage, citizenship, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, genetic predisposition or carrier status, status as a victim or any other classification protected by applicable local law.

## Overhead costs

_Reset typically supports projects, not overhead._

Awards from our open calls generally do not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of objectives or deliverables. For example, indirect costs such as operational or administrative expenses are not supported. This is in part due to contractual vehicle we primarily relay upon to award open call applications. This policy ensures that programmatic funds are focused on accomplishing our goals.

In the limited instances where Reset determines that an overhead cost would be permitted, such costs cannot be greater than 10 percent of the overall cost of the award. Projects seeking an exception bear the burden of clearly demonstrating how the lack of such an inclusion will prevent the completion of the project’s objectives.

In even more limited instances where Reset decides to give a core or general operating grant, the above does not apply.

## The honorarium

## Application video

In our open calls, we may ask you for a video to introduce yourselves, explain what you're doing and why, and tell us anything else you want to about the other key members or the project. This is not required. This question is an opportunity for applicants to humanize the submission process. The effort required to review received number of applications in a timely way rarely provides the opportunity to engage applicants face-to-face during our review process. 

We acknowledge the concerns raised in asking this question: anxiety, bias, awkward, time, etc. If you think the video is an opportunity to highlight something in your application not easily conveyed elsewhere, include one. If not, do not include a video.

Below are some recommendations to follow if you are considering a video for your application.

**The video should be 1 minute long and should contain nothing except you or others talking.** 

No screenshots or post-production wizardry please; we don’t want this to turn into a video making contest. If you’re going to spend time making something cool, put it into your project.

**This is not the place to submit a demo or promotional video.**

If you have a demo for your project, there is a place in the application for that. However, we don't want to see any promotional video. Here, we want to hear how you and your partners communicate.

**If you have more than one key partner or team member, try to have them in the video.**

If you can't be in the same room at the same time, you may want to record a video conference conversation instead.

**Don't mark it as private or disallow embedding.**

We won't be able to see it. Please note that because of how our system is built, the view count may not increase even though we do watch your video.

**If you are in a country where services like Vimeo or YouTube is unavailable, you may use an alternate service, like YouKu for China.** 

If you use YouKu, you may want to set a password on your video. You can provide the password in the application.

**Please do not recite a script written beforehand.** 

Just talk spontaneously as you would to a friend. People delivering memorized speeches \(or worse still, text read off the screen\) usually come off as rigid. 

**Please do not add any background music to your video.**

We regularly give up 10 seconds into a video because we can’t stand the random background music.

**Watch your own video before you submit.** 

Make sure you can hear what you are saying. A significant fraction of the videos we get are inaudible. If you’re going to apply at all, you may as well apply with a video we can hear.

## **Review criteria**

The following is a list of criteria Reset uses to evaluate all applications:

* **Quality of project idea:** Applications should exhibit originality, substance, precision and relevance to Reset and its mission, as well as the focus and priorities of this request.
* **Ability to achieve objectives:** A relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity of the organisation or individual. The work plan should adhere to the overview and guidelines described above. Objectives should be ambitious, yet measurable and achievable.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Any overhead and administrative components included in the application should be kept as low as possible. All items should be necessary and appropriate. Cost-sharing and/or matching funds from other sources is strongly encouraged and is viewed favourably by Reset.
* **Multiplier effect/sustainability:** Applications should address how the expected results will contribute toward our goals. Applications should address how the effort will be sustained in the long-term.
* **Applicants’ record and capacity:** Reset will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the project’s objectives.

## Term

Awards are generally six to 18 - and no more than 24 - months in duration. 

From time to time Reset may consider applications to extend existing contracts beyond the initial project period. Any such decision will be subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the applicants, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of programme priorities. 

Fellows commit to working between 10, 20, 30, 40 hours a week for a term of either three, six, nine, or 12 months in duration.  If you would like to apply for a fellowship but cannot commit to a full term or have a specific start date in mind, please specify that in your application.

## Funding

Reset awards are performance-based contracts or project funding agreements signed directly with the applicant. Reset has no legal obligation to make any payments unless and until an agreement is completed to the full satisfaction and executed by both parties. For contracts and project funding, payment is issued on completion of stated objectives, activities, and/or deliverable per a schedule outlined in the application and agreement.

Based on the current priorities of the program, applicants are limited to one grant award from an Open Call. Once the term of an award expires, including any extension granted beyond the initial project period, an applicant is not eligible to apply for an Open Call. This limitation applies on an applicant-by-applicant basis. For example, an individual that receives an award is also able to apply for a different project on behalf of an organization and two for-profit businesses with the same owner are each eligible to apply for an award. 

Applications that request more than the award ceiling of $600,000 USD, or less than the award floor of $5,000 USD, may, at our discretion, be deemed technically ineligible. Note that our target support ceiling is $300,000 USD, with most supported efforts receiving between $50,000 USD and $200,000 USD.

**Fellows** will receive a monthly stipend based on the number of hours a week they commit to working, a travel stipend of up to $5,000 USD \(depending on project needs\), any hardware needed such as a computer or mobile device, and access to Reset internal resources \(depending on project needs\). The hourly rate for all fellows is $40 USD. As a result: a fellow committing to 20 hours a week for nine months would permit a total of $28,800 USD \(dispersed in $3,200 USD/month payments\). A 30 hour a week commitment for 12 months would permit the fellow to $57,600 USD \(dispersed in $4,800 USD/month payments\). A 10 hour week commitment for three months would permit the fellow $4,800 USD \(dispersed in $1,600 USD/month payments\).

Reset reserves the right to award less or more than the funds requested or suggest an alternate agreement type than requested as deemed in the best interest of Reset priorities.

## **Visas**

Any individual will need to acquire the appropriate work authorisation. Applicants will need to secure their own visa and work permit, if applicable. We are glad to provide visa letters upon request.

## Monitoring & evaluation

Reset views monitoring and evaluation as a way to learn from the partners we support, share lessons learned with future applicants, and also raise our partner’s profile with other potential funders and the public writ large. This improves the collective knowledge of the community and contributes to its sustainability.

Monitoring and evaluation assessments are largely based on predetermined and agreed-upon metrics, deliverables and goals set out in the performance-based contract or funding agreement, as applicable. Successful applicants can expect regular contact with their assigned Reset team member and host organisation if applicable. Monitoring consists of monthly reports and phone, email, or in-person discussions and consultations as needed. We typically ask successful applicants to submit brief monthly updates about their work to Reset, their host organisation as applicable, and the broader Reset network. This allows others to review and comment on the work, encouraging collaboration.

## Collective commitment

Applicants and partners in our network must share our vision, strive to uphold our principles and values, and hold us accountable by providing us feedback, especially if that feedback is critical.
