# Flash grants

During the process of managing Open Calls, we see many incredible applicants ultimately not receive an award due to various factors. We encourage all such applicants to apply again in the future - using our feedback to prepare a more competitive application with hopefully better results. In the meantime, however, we don't want those applicants to be sidelined. That's why we also offer two kinds of flash grants to initially unsuccessful applicants.

Inspired by and directly modeled on the Shuttleworth Foundation's successful [**programme**](https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/flash-grants/), our flash grant programme is another way we at Reset are [_**reimagining philanthropy**_](https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Shades-Green-Reimagining-Philanthropy/dp/1694497119) - with the hope of growing our network and work even further.

With an eye toward growing our network and work even further, Reset is currently testing two types of flash grants:

* [**Collaborative flash grants**](https://guide.reset.tech/fund-guidelines/flash-grants#collaborative-flash-grants) ****- these grants allow unsuccessful applicants to see each other's top-line project ideas \(with permission\). Applicants can then connect and come up with exciting collaborative projects for which they can apply to receive flash grant funding through an exclusive and short application process.
* \*\*\*\*[**Referral flash grants**](https://guide.reset.tech/fund-guidelines/flash-grants#referral-flash-grants) ****- these grants allow existing partners \(including those who have joined Reset's network via a flash grant\) to refer new applicants and create new connections. Through a light workflow, existing partners can invite up to two other individuals to complete a short application and receive flash grant funding.

Learn more about each of these grants below, including who can participate, how they will work, and why we're offering them.

## Who can participate?

To participate and be eligible to receive a Collaborative flash grant or a Referral flash grant, you must:

* Submit a complete application to one of our Open Calls;
* When submitting your application, choose _**NOT**_ to opt-out of sharing application information with other applicants \(this step is essential\);
* Be the point of contact for an application we determined was within our remit; and,
* Be the point of contact for an application no older than one year.

To participate in a Referral flash grant, you must also:

* Have been successfully funded by Reset within the past year.

## How do flash grants work?

### Collaborative flash grants

1. You apply to one of our Open Calls.
2. We complete our review of your application.
3. If you meet the above criteria, your application will be added to a registry of others like you. 
4. You will be given access to that registry for review.
5. If you see other interesting applications, reach out to their applicant, get to know them, and come up with an exciting, collaborative idea.
6. Using a special short application form \(which only becomes available to you while you are listed in the registry\), you and up to five other applicants can submit an application for a Collaborative flash grant.
7. Once we receive your application, we will conduct a review to determine whether or not to issue an award.
8. If the application is accepted, each participating applicant will be awarded.

### Referral flash grants

Any applicant with an approved application \(including Collaborative flash grant awardees\) is empowered to make up to two referrals. After an application is approved, follow these steps to make a referral:

1. Upon approval of your application, you will be given access to a referral form. 
2. Complete and submit this referral form \(in which you will recommend another applicant or potential applicant to receive award\).
3. Once we receive your completed referral form, we will invite the referred individual to complete and submit a special short application form for a Referral flash grant.
4. Once we receive the referred individual's application, we will conduct a very light review to ensure making the award would be within our remit and legal. Only in extremely rare cases will we not approve.
5. After we approve the application, the applicant will be awarded. If they shared their application information, they are also eligible for participating in a Collaborative flash grant \(see above\).

#### Conditions for Referral flash grants:

* You can only make a referral within the first year of your approval, regardless of how long we fund your project. 
* You only get to make two referrals.
* The referral cannot directly benefit an effort for your that we are already actively supporting. They can, however, be working closely in your space.

## How much funding does a flash grant provide?

Each award is worth $5,000 USD per recipient. 

## Why are we doing this?

### You deserve more

Through our Open Calls, we are only able to approve a small percentage of the total number of applications we receive. Yet we believe the knowledge and experience you share through your application is more powerful than the money we have. Traditionally, donors only share that power of money with themselves and those they are able to initially fund. But because you shared your power and knowledge with us, we want to do our  best to find a way to share our power with you - even those who applied for funding but did not initially have their application accepted. That's why we're testing out flash grants, and why we're always committed to providing substantial feedback to every applicant whose Open Call application is not accepted \(we actually spend more time writing dismissal messages than approvals\).

### Defined by our network

We believe the lasting impact we make will be defined by the individual nodes in our network, each node's agency to expand the network by making new and diverse connections, and the positive change that occurs through our support of each node \(both for their beneficiaries and us\). Providing flash grants is another opportunity for us to continue to expand our network.
