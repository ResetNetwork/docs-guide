# Fellowships

## Information Control Fellowship

Through this fellowship, Reset strives to support a diverse and global group of individuals performing multidisciplinary and intersectional work to advance our understanding of how [**surveillance capitalism**](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/how-we-see-the-world#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) enables information controls. [**Information Control Fellows**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls/information-control-fellowship/) examine what type of harms are being caused by this practice, where they are occurring, who they are affecting, and how they can be mitigated and defended against in the future. We believe better virtuous technology-centred interventions are needed to document, mitigate, and reduce these harms and ensure a healthier and more democratic society. The goal of the Information Control Fellowship programme is to help make these interventions possible through targeted research, development, and investigation.

Information Control Fellows embed \(virtually or physically\) with a host organisation for the duration of their Fellowship. Work can be performed from any location that Reset and the host organisation can provide support, so long as fellows are capable of maintaining an online presence during selected work times and participating in regular check-ins \(as needed by the host organisation or Reset\).

## Resident Fellowship

Through this fellowship, Reset strives to support a diverse and global group of individuals performing multidisciplinary and intersectional work to advance our understanding of the harms caused by surveillance capitalism and the opportunities to counteract them. [**Resident Fellows**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls/resident-fellowship/) ****are able to leverage Reset and our network \(the partners, communities, and fields of practice that Reset supports\) to strengthen society's ability to understand, mitigate, and defend against these complex issues. The goal of the Resident Fellowship programme is to create new connections and perspectives that will ultimately deepen and expand our network’s understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Resident Fellows join the Reset team for a fixed period of time in order to work on a specific project designed to immediately change Reset’s way of working and thinking \(or have a high likelihood of doing so shortly after completion\). In addition to advancing Reset’s organisational capabilities through exposure to new perspectives and expertise, this Fellowship is also designed to produce public-facing outputs, support fellows engaging external actors, strengthen the fields in which we operate, and foster collaborative activities within the Reset network itself \(among other fellows, current and past Reset-supported efforts, and the communities we consider most important\).

Resident Fellows embed \(virtually or physically\) within Reset for the duration of their Fellowship. Work can be performed from any location that Reset can provide support, so long as fellows are capable of maintaining an online presence during selected work times and participating in regular check-ins as needed by Reset.
