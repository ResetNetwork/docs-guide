## **Common dismissal responses**

### **Out of Scope / Completely Outside Remit**

Activities described within this application do not clearly fit within the scope of our goals, which aims to advance research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, foster development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advance a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. However, if the scope of your project should change and fits within these goals and principles, we encourage you to reapply.

### **Somewhat Outside Remit**

Your application raises an important issue, however, it is unfortunately not directly within the aim of our goals. Where your application addresses critical issues, the proposed project was not considered adequately tied to surveillance capitalism or one of the other interrelated obstacles Reset is working to overcome. Reset is focused on advancing research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, fostering development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advocating for a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. While this focus area provides Reset with considerable latitude in funding determinations, it also defines the limits. Reviewers did not identify an adequate connection as to how the proposed project would address specific problems related to these issues. If you consider this determination inaccurate, you are welcome to re-apply and more explicitly highlight how your idea squarely aligns with our mission.   


### **Duplicative with Existing Efforts**

While the proposed project was found to be consistent with the mission of Reset, a number of ongoing efforts exist to address the stated issues. Reviewers did not identify an adequate number of unique traits that would be specific to this project. The applicant is welcome to re-apply with a stronger demonstration of how the project is distinct from others.   


### **Not Passed Proof of Concept Phase**

The application appears to broadly fall within the mission of Reset. While the project described was seen as having the potential to generate impact, reviewers did not identify an adequate demonstration that it has moved beyond an initial idea, into a viable Proof of Concept Phase, or beyond. This was a result of the omission of key details in the application around the project implementation. As this project progresses, we encourage you to consider reapplying as the underlying steps of this project are more well known.

### **Research Not Applied**

Reset-supported projects are advancing research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation. While the research described was broadly in line with our mission, reviewers did not find the proposed project to be well-grounded in rectifying the damage being caused by surveillance capitalism including efforts of generating awareness to audiences outside traditional research communities.

### **Too Expensive**

We found the funding amount requested to be significantly higher than what Reset is able to provide for efforts of similar scale. Reset awards at this level for first-time projects are very infrequent and come with an extremely high bar of justification. Please note that while Reset’s target support ceiling is $300,000, most supported efforts are receiving between $50,000 and $200,000. This allows us to empower a new pool of technology and community efforts that may not have been otherwise supported.

### **Core Support**

Activities described within this application appeared to fit within the scope of our goals, which aim to advance research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, foster development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advance a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. Nonetheless, the applicant appeared to be requesting general organisational support which is not something Reset provides at this time \(See also [https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/fund-guidelines\#overhead-costs](https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/fund-guidelines#overhead-costs)\). The applicant is welcome to re-apply as long as a clearly defined set of objectives and deliverables can be provided.  

### **Impact of Outputs Unclear**

Activities described within this application do fit within the scope of our goals, which aim to advance research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, foster development of technologies to combat surveillance capitalism and digital threats to democracy, and advance a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. Nonetheless, reviewers expressed skepticism that the proposed outputs would generate commensurate impact with the funds being requested \(or compared to other applications reviewed at the same time\), in particular, advances in policy and/or improved corporate practices for priority beneficiaries \(https://guide.reset.tech/for-applicants/fund-guidelines\#target-beneficiaries\). The applicant is welcome to re-apply as long as a clear demonstration around how the project will assist the general public can be provided.  

### **Too Focused on Providing Internet Access or ICT4D**

Reset strongly believes in the benefits of projects such as yours that provide under-served populations with Internet access and online services. Nonetheless, Reset aims to advance research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, foster development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advance a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. While these criteria provide Reset with considerable latitude in funding determinations, it also defines the limits. Numerous other programs have the remit and associated expertise to support international information and communication technologies development projects. In many cases, this includes bringing Internet connectivity and essential services to those without it. A list of potential supporters can be found at [https://guide.opentech.fund/appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support\#information-and-communications-technologies-for-development-ict-4-d-including-deploying-internet-connectivity](https://guide.opentech.fund/appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support#information-and-communications-technologies-for-development-ict-4-d-including-deploying-internet-connectivity).

### **Government and/or non-corporate surveillance / interference / data-collection**

Reset strongly believes in the benefits of projects such as yours that combat surveillance by governments and other non-corporate actors. While the grave danger to human rights posed by these actors is undeniable, we aim to counter the threats posed by Big Tech companies to democratic institutions. Reviewers did not identify an adequate connection as to how the proposed project would address specific problems related to these issues. If you consider this determination inaccurate, you are welcome to re-apply and more explicitly highlight how your idea squarely aligns with our mission. 

### **Online Harassment**

We would like to stress that online harassment is an issue that desperately needs to be tackled for the Internet to serve as a safe place for all communities. Reset’s mission is focused on advancing research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, fostering development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advocating for a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. Reviewers did not identify a clear connection between the project and these objectives. If you consider this determination inaccurate, you are welcome to re-apply and more explicitly highlight how your idea squarely aligns with our mission. 

### **Broader Privacy / Security Technology**

While advancing the proposed project would clearly help individuals increase their online privacy, reset’s mission is focused on advancing research into the ways technology is harming democracy and opportunities for mitigation, fostering development of technologies to combat surveillance commerce and digital threats to democracy, and advocating for a global public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies. Reviewers did not find your application to adequately demonstrate how the objectives would be advanced by supporting the further development of the technology being focused on. If you consider this determination inaccurate, you are welcome to re-apply and more explicitly highlight how this project squarely aligns with our mission.
