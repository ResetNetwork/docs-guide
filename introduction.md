# Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this guide is to provide you with all the information you need to successfully submit an application to Reset. Whether you're planning to submit to one of the funds or fellowships, or you are simply curious about how our program works, this guide is for you. Through the sections found on the left, you'll find guidelines both general \(relevant to all our funding mechanisms\) and specific open calls.

## What is inside

This guide is designed to act as a starting point for understanding the goals of our open calls, funding criteria, what we look for in an ideal application, choosing the right funding mechanism, how to best structure your application, the application workflows, and other useful pointers about applying to us. In addition to making things more clear for would-be applicants, we hope that by compiling this information publicly, weâ€™re making good on our commitment to openly share all possible aspects of our work as transparently as possible.

### Always changing

This guide is a living document. Much of the information found here here is informed by the numerous inquiries sent our way by curious would-be applicants, those who we dismissed, and those we awarded. If you came here with a question and you find your answer, it is thanks to them. In that spirit, we welcome your feedback, thoughts, and opinions on how to make this guide more useful and relevant to your needs. Feel free to comment directly within the guide as you see fit, or write to us at hello@reset.tech
