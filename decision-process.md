# Decision process

We actively look for opportunities that align with our [goals & objectives](introduction/goals-objectives.md), are the [types of work](introduction/goals-objectives.md#type-of-work) we care most about, and support our [principles & values](introduction/principles-values.md).

We make different types and sizes of investment and funding, depending on the opportunity. This helps us build an exciting and diverse portfolio of organisations and companies from around the world.

We always aim to be transparent about how we invest, so we’ve outlined the eight stages we typically follow below. These may be subject to change as we're constantly looking for ways to improve our process.

## Stages

1. **You apply:** It begins with you.
2. **Team review:** We get to know you.
3. **Initial determination:** We will have questions.
4. **Additional information:** You have the answers.
5. **Review panel:** We get other's thoughts.
6. **Final approval:** All final decisions made.
7. **Legal review:** Agreements and lawyers.
8. **Oversight:** What happens after approval.

### You apply

The process begins as soon as you submit an application.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2" %}
### Team review

After the application round deadline has passed, we will begin our internal review process.

We conduct a deeper assessment of the application – including speaking to partners, other investors or funders, staff, and any other relevant third parties.

We may end up asking you clarifying questions at this point to help us make our initial determination.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3" %}
### Initial determination

Once we’ve had the chance to review your application and ask clarifying questions if needed, we’ll then contact you \(along with all applicants for that round\) through our submission system and let you know whether your application is being declined or considered further. 

If we are continuing to consider your application, we may ask you to submit further information or even a complete another application for due diligence purposes. We will specify a date by which you will be expected to respond.

If we decline your concept note, we’ll provide you with feedback on why your concept was not considered to move forward.

### Additional information
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="5" %}
### Review panel

Our review panels are made up of a diverse array of subject matter experts who understand various relevant fields and issues as they relate to our goals and objectives. They are subject matter experts who have a vested interest in Reset funding decisions and are uniquely positioned to bolster our project oversight capacity, expertise, perspective, and accountability. At least two reviews from Advisory Council members are required before an application can move forward. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="6" %}
### Final approval

Before finalizing approval, we will consult our finance and legal teams, as well as any other relevant experts, and depending on the amount and risk, we may also consult our steering committee. For-profit investments often require more extensive structuring discussions at this stage, which may be an iterative process.

Upon completion of this stage, we will inform you whether your application has been accepted or declined and why.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="7" %}
### Legal review

* Documentation drafted by our legal team
* Documentation sent for review and signature
* Partnership can begin

Once we have finalized approvals and the terms of the investment or grant, including agreeing structure and reporting requirements with the organisation, documentation will be drafted by our legal team and, if necessary, external counsel. It will then be sent for review and signature – and the partnership can begin.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="8" %}
### Oversight

Once a partnership begins, we look forward to working closely with the organisation, company, project, or fellow and providing ongoing support. A Reset team member will be assigned to assist you for the duration of your work with us. Partners will work this team member to determine how best we can help moving forward. We encourage open communication, will schedule regular catch-ups, and agree on a regular reporting structure.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Just a quick note:** Approval is not guaranteed at any stage of the process. If the opportunity is not approved, we will always explain why and provide clear and constructive feedback.
