{% hint style="info" %}
## Does Reset support projects, individuals, or both?

Reset does not have any requirements regarding an applicant’s status - whether for-profit, nonprofit, or a single individual, located inside or outside the United States, so long as the proposed effort fits within OTF’s mission, goals, and focus areas, it may be considered.

Reset supports both individuals and projects through several different funding mechanisms. See apply.reset.tech for available options.

## Does my project sound like something Reset would support?

Reset encourages any potential applicant to first explore Reset’s [**areas of work**](https://www.reset.tech/work/). If it sounds like your project might be a good fit, you’ll want to identify which [**fund or fellowship**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls/) is most appropriate for you. From there, submitting a concept note is the best next step.

## I submitted an application. When can I expect to receive a response?

Immediately after submitting your application, you should receive an email from Reset confirming that we have received your submission. After that, your next contact with OTF will be a determination notice, which you can expect within a month from when that round’s application window closes.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Does Reset support projects that are commercial or proprietary in nature?

Yes but, Reset places high priority on funding tools that are open-source and freely available to download and use, ensuring a low barrier to user adoption and use.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## Does Reset support overhead costs?

Reset generally does not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of contractually stated objectives or deliverables. In the very limited instances where Reset determines that an overhead cost is permissible, such costs cannot be greater than 10% of the overall project cost.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## Do I have to include an attachment with my application?

Attaching a resume or CV is required for first time applicants. If you’re applying as an organization, include those of key team members that will actually be working on the project. Beyond this requirement, if you have something you feel strengthens your application and it can’t be added as a link, including such materials as an attachment is fine.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## In what language should I submit my application?

Please note that English is the language of record for all applications, and those submitted in other languages may not be reviewed as competitively as those submitted in English.
