## Does Reset support projects, individuals, or both?

{% hint style="info" %}
Reset does not have any requirements regarding an applicant’s status - whether for-profit, nonprofit, or a single individual so long as the proposed effort fits within the aims of our Open Call, goals, and focus areas, it may be considered.  A consortia of multiple people or organisations with one individual or organisation designated as the lead applicant are all welcome to apply. Applicants may be located in or organized under the laws of any country, except for any country on which the United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union has imposed trade restrictions or export sanctions.
{% endhint %}



## Does my project sound like something Reset would support?

{% hint style="info" %}
Reset encourages any potential applicant to first explore Reset’s [**areas of work**](https://www.reset.tech/work/). If it sounds like your project might be a good fit, you’ll want to identify which [**fund or fellowship**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls/) is most appropriate for you. From there, ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements and submit an application in response to an existing open call. Note that approval is not guaranteed.
{% endhint %}

## When does Reset accept applications? When are the deadlines?

{% hint style="info" %}
Applications for all our open calls are accepted on a rolling basis. You can submit at any time throughout the year, with “round” deadlines every other month. Round deadlines occur on January 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, September 1, and November 1. Concept notes must be submitted no later than 23:59 \(11:59PM\) GMT on the date of the deadline in order to be considered as part of that round.
{% endhint %}

## Is there a minimum or maximum monetary amount for funding requests?

{% hint style="info" %}
Minimum of $5,000 and maximum of $600,000 for a year-long agreement. Note, however, that our target support ceiling is $300,000; most supported efforts receive between $50,000 and $200,000.
{% endhint %}



## I submitted an application. When can I expect to receive a response?

{% hint style="info" %}
Immediately after submitting your application, you should receive an email from Reset confirming that we have received your submission. After that, your next contact with Reset will be a determination notice, which you can expect within a month from when that round’s application window closes.
{% endhint %}

## Does Reset support projects that are commercial or proprietary in nature?

{% hint style="info" %}
Yes but, Reset places high priority on funding the creation or ongoing support of things that are open-source and freely available to download and use, ensuring a low barrier to user adoption and use.
{% endhint %}

## Does Reset support overhead costs?

{% hint style="info" %}
Reset generally does not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of contractually stated objectives or deliverables. In the very limited instances where Reset determines that an overhead cost is permissible, such costs cannot be greater than 10% of the overall project cost. See our [guidance]() for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Do I have to include an attachment with my application?

{% hint style="info" %}
Attaching a resume or CV is required for first time applicants. If you’re applying as an organization, include those of key team members that will actually be working on the project. Beyond this requirement, if you have something you feel strengthens your application and it can’t be added as a link, including such materials as an attachment is fine.
{% endhint %}

## In what language should I submit my application?

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that English is the language of record for all applications, and those submitted in other languages may not be reviewed as competitively as those submitted in English.
{% endhint %}

## Do I own my work?

{% hint style="info" %}
Yes! We encourage collaboration and prioritize openness with the Reset network of partners and the public, but you’ll own the work you do as part of the work we support. We will work with on a disclosure strategy for any original findings. Be aware, we’re looking for applicants who share our desire to advance civil societies understanding. Therefore we will always ask applicants to make new methodologies, tools, other code, and findings they develop as part of their support an open source license—so Reset, the general public, others in the public interest tech ecosystem can benefit from a growing set of shared resources.
