# Fund guidelines

## Priorities

What must be true is that you and/or your organisation have an understanding of the challenges of [surveillance capitalism](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) within affected societies, a passion to see harms end, an idea or vision of your and/or your organisation’s role towards ending it, how Reset augments that vision, a clear way to disseminate the outcomes broadly, and excitement to be a part of the effort.

We seek proposals from all around the world, with a priority for interventions and projects that will have the greatest global-effect. Of utmost priority, are projects that clearly complement one or more efforts to positively shift policy, market, social norms, or other technical outcomes.

Everything Reset supports must be a clear attempt to advance our [aims](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/goals-objectives), be a type of [work](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/goals-objectives#type-of-work) we prioritise, focus on a specific set of [harms or challenges](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/how-we-see-the-world) that are important to us, and meet or exceed our criteria.

## **Collective commitment**

Applicants and partners in our network must share our[ vision](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction#our-vision-for-the-future), strive to uphold our[ principles and values](https://guide.reset.tech/introduction/principles-values) , and hold us accountable by providing us[ feedback](https://guide.reset.tech/give-us-feedback), especially if that feedback is critical. We will do our best to make it as easy as possible to receive.

## Type of work

The following lists the type of work we support to mitigate the harms and challenges created by surveillance capitalism. Ideal applications always fit within one of these types of work:

* **Policy & Advocacy:** The global development and advancement of a public policy agenda that sets fair rules and standards for Big Tech companies, ensuring they better serve democracy.
* **Research:** Networks of researchers studying the interplay between democracy and technology, with the aim of informing current policy debates, creating better technology, and improving civic engagement.
* **Technology:** The design and implementation of both existing and new tools that support in-depth research, activist engagement, educational insights, and viable virtuous alternatives to the dominate exploitative platforms.
* **Civic engagement:** Those working to educate the public about the problems caused by digital threats to democracy and the subversion of the internet.

## Ideal applicants

Our Open Calls are a competitive process with publicly available open applications. We may onboard one or two partners every two months, more, or none during that period, depending on the quality of applications, our capacity, and priorities. We are purposefully looking for a diverse mix of partner organisations and individuals. We are particularly keen to receive applications from people who consider themselves under-represented within the communities and fields affected by or responding to surveillance capitalism. Individuals applying may be from university faculty and/or civil society organisations, corporations, including those on sabbatical, or independent scholars. We are disciplinarily agnostic and welcome people from critical, empirical, technical, legal, and humanistic fields.

We strongly encourage applications from computer scientists, human rights scholars, human-computer interaction, anthropologists, ethnographers, statisticians, and mathematicians who are seeking to apply their scientific and technical skills to social problems. Practitioners may include general technologists, software developers, engineers, information security researchers, data scientists, data visualisation experts, digital rights defenders, designers, lawyers, researchers, community organisers, social scientists, artists, advocates and activists, educators, journalists, entrepreneurs, industry actors, policy analysts, public intellectuals, those coming out of a government office or position, those whose practice doesn’t fit squarely into conventional categories, and all others are all welcome to apply.

Below is a list of application criteria that we prioritise when considering Open Call awards. Many great applications do NOT meet all these criteria.

* Are open and collaborative in nature
* From within communities affected most by the harms of surveillance capitalism or are co-designing and co-developing with them
* Possess a strong technical understanding of the internet, digital threats faced by victims of digital rights abuse and digital rights activists and defenders, and digital security tools and tactics that can be used to address those threats
* Promoting a deeper understanding of surveillance capitalism’s challenges and limitations
* Ability to explain complex technical subjects clearly and respectfully to audiences of specialists in non-technical fields
* Want to solve a currently unaddressed challenge or preempt an emerging one
* A flexible and enthusiastic approach to work, including the humility and grace to work effectively with others in a collaborative, fast-paced environment, a “can do” attitude
* Action-orientated and entrepreneurial self-starters who are self-motivated, willing and able to work effectively and independently alone and together with a team remotely
* A high level of energy and self-motivation with a passion for continuous learning
* Excellent ability to work collaboratively and respectfully with others in multicultural teams, across organizational boundaries and multiple time zones, and with team members at all levels
* Are actively or proposing to work on a solution to a problem experienced by more people than the applicant with some evidence the people are demanding the proposed solution
* Individuals without a history of prior support, and who demonstrate a deep understanding of the harms surveillance capitalism has on democracy
* Individuals of all ages irrespective of nationality, residency, creed, gender, or other factors, are welcome to apply
* Have demonstrated experience administering successful projects, preferably targeting the requested programme area, or similarly challenging programme environments where Reset reserves the right to request additional background information on organisations
* Non-profit organisation/non-government organisation, including U.S., U.K, or E.U. based NGO, PIO, or foreign NGO, non-profit university or research institution in any country, for-profit organisation or business in any country, or consortia of multiple people or organisations with one individual or organisation designated as the lead applicant are all welcome to apply
* Are **not** requesting support for work that duplicates or simply adds to efforts supported by other [Omidyar Group organisations](https://www.omidyargroup.com/organizations/)
* Are **not** within countries that the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union has trade restrictions or export sanctions
* Do **not** reflect any type of support for any member, affiliate or representative of a designated terrorist organisation, whether or not elected members of the government.

## Target beneficiaries

## **A commitment to diversity**

Reset seeks to embed diversity, equity and inclusion \(DEI\) into our work. We are committed to providing equal opportunity and an environment free of discrimination. For Open Calls, this means we will consider all applications equally, without regard to race, creed, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin or ancestry, alienage, citizenship, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, genetic predisposition or carrier status, status as a victim or any other classification protected by applicable local law.

In a bid to empower a new pool of talent, Reset will prioritise projects coming from individuals or organisations who are new to us, the digital rights community, identify as under-represented within related fields, and that are requesting less than $300,000 for efforts within a 12-month duration or less.

## Overhead costs

_Reset typically supports projects, not overhead._

Awards from our open calls generally do not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of objectives or deliverables. For example, indirect costs such as operational or administrative expenses are not supported. This is in part due to contractual vehicle we primarily relay upon to award open call applications. This policy ensures that programmatic funds are focused on accomplishing our goals.

In the limited instances where Reset determines that an overhead cost would be permitted, such costs cannot be greater than 10 percent of the overall cost of the award. Projects seeking an exception bear the burden of clearly demonstrating how the lack of such an inclusion will prevent the completion of the project’s objectives.

In even more limited instances where Reset decides to give a core or general operating grant, the above does not apply.

## The honorarium

## The application video

In our open calls, we may ask you for a video to introduce yourselves, explain what you're doing and why, and tell us anything else you want to about the other key members or the project. This is not required. This question is an opportunity for applicants to humanize the submission process. The effort required to review received number of applications in a timely way rarely provides the opportunity to engage applicants face-to-face during our review process. 

We acknowledge the concerns raised in asking this question: anxiety, bias, awkward, time, etc. If you think the video is an opportunity to highlight something in your application not easily conveyed elsewhere, include one. If not, do not include a video.

Below are some recommendations to follow if you are considering a video for your application.

**The video should be 1 minute long and should contain nothing except you or others talking.** 

No screenshots or post-production wizardry please; we don’t want this to turn into a video making contest. If you’re going to spend time making something cool, put it into your project.

**This is not the place to submit a demo or promotional video.**

If you have a demo for your project, there is a place in the application for that. However, we don't want to see any promotional video. Here, we want to hear how you and your partners communicate.

**If you have more than one key partner or team member, try to have them in the video.**

If you can't be in the same room at the same time, you may want to record a video conference conversation instead.

**Don't mark it as private or disallow embedding.**

We won't be able to see it. Please note that because of how our system is built, the view count may not increase even though we do watch your video.

**If you are in a country where services like Vimeo or YouTube is unavailable, you may use an alternate service, like YouKu for China.** 

If you use YouKu, you may want to set a password on your video. You can provide the password in the application.

**Please do not recite a script written beforehand.** 

Just talk spontaneously as you would to a friend. People delivering memorized speeches \(or worse still, text read off the screen\) usually come off as stupid. Unless you’re a good enough actor to fake spontaneity, you lose more in the stilted delivery than you gain from a more polished message.

**Please do not add any background music to your video.**

We regularly give up 10 seconds into a video because we can’t stand the random background music.

**Watch your own video before you submit.** 

Make sure you can hear what you are saying. A significant fraction of the videos we get are inaudible. If you’re going to apply at all, you may as well apply with a video we can hear.

## **Review criteria**

The following is a list of criteria Reset uses to evaluate all applications:

* **Quality of project idea:** Applications should exhibit originality, substance, precision and relevance to Reset and its mission, as well as the focus and priorities of this request
* **Ability to achieve objectives:** A relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity of the organisation or individual. The work plan should adhere to the overview and guidelines described above. Objectives should be ambitious, yet measurable and achievable
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Any overhead and administrative components included in the application should be kept as low as possible. All items should be necessary and appropriate. Cost-sharing and/or matching funds from other sources is strongly encouraged and is viewed favourably by Reset
* **Multiplier effect/sustainability:** Applications should address how the expected results will contribute toward our goals. Applications should address how the effort will be sustained in the long-term
* **Applicants’ record and capacity:** Reset will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the project’s objectives.

## Term

Awards are generally six to 18 - and no more than 24 - months in duration. **Fellows** commit to working between 10, 20, 30, 40 hours a week for a term of either three, six, nine or 12 months in duration.

From time to time Reset may consider applications to extend existing contracts beyond the initial project period. Any such decision will be subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the applicants, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of programme priorities. If you would like to apply for a fellowship but cannot commit to a full term or have a specific start date in mind, please specify that in your application.

Reset conducts review rounds every two months starting on January 1st, then in March, May, July, September and November. Therefore, if you applied in December, we would not review your application until January 1st and the earliest you could start the fellowship would be March 1st and conclude December 1st for a 9-month fellowship. There will be delays such as constraints on team and reviewer availability. Have patience.

## Funding

Reset awards are performance-based contracts or project funding agreements signed directly with the applicant. Reset has no legal obligation to make any payments unless and until an agreement is completed to the full satisfaction and executed by both parties. For contracts and project funding, payment is issued on completion of stated objectives, activities, and/or deliverable per a schedule outlined in the application and agreement.

Applications that request more than the award ceiling of $600,000, or less than the award floor of $5,000, may, at our discretion, be deemed technically ineligible. Note that our target support ceiling is $300,000, with most supported efforts receiving between $50,000 and $200,000.

**Fellows** will receive a monthly stipend based on the number of hours a week they commit to working, a travel stipend of up to 5,000 USD \(depending on project needs\), any hardware needed such as a computer or mobile device, and access to Reset internal resources \(depending on project needs\). The hourly rate for all fellows is 40 USD. As a result: a fellow committing to 20 hours a week for nine months would permit a total of 28,800 USD \(dispersed in 3,200 USD/month payments\). A 30 hour a week commitment for 12 months would permit the fellow to 57,600 USD \(dispersed in 4,800 USD/month payments\). A 10 hour week commitment for three months would permit the fellow 4,800 USD \(dispersed in 1,600 USD/month payments\).

Reset reserves the right to award less or more than the funds requested or suggest an alternate agreement type than requested as deemed in the best interest of Reset priorities.

## **VISAs**

While we welcome applications from outside the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU, we are currently unable to support the acquisition of visas. If you are applying from outside these regions and are accepted, and wish to visit countries that you need a visa for, you will need to secure your own visa and, depending on your situation, work permit. We are glad to provide visa letters upon request.

## Monitoring and evaluation

Reset views monitoring and evaluation as a way to learn from the partners we support, share lessons learned with future applicants, and also raise our partner’s profile with other potential funders and the public writ large. This improves the collective knowledge of the community and contributes to its sustainability.

Monitoring and evaluation assessments are largely based on predetermined and agreed-upon metrics, deliverables and goals. Successful applicants can expect regular contact with their assigned Reset team member and host organisation if applicable. Monitoring consists of monthly reports and phone, email, or in-person discussions and consultations as needed. We typically ask successful applicants to submit brief monthly updates about their work to Reset, their host organisation as applicable, and the broader Reset network. This allows others to review and comment on the work, encouraging collaboration.
