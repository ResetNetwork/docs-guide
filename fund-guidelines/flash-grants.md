# Flash grants

Flash grants are an ongoing opportunity we offer qualifying applicants. They are modeled directly from Shuttleworth Foundation's own successful flash grant program.

We are experimenting with two types of flash grants:

* Collaborative flash grants
* Referral flash grants

## Who can participate?

To participate in both, you must:

* Submit a complete application to one of our open calls;
* _**NOT**_ opt-out of sharing application information with other applicants when submitting your application;
* Be the point of contact for an application we determined was within our remit; and,
* Be the point of contact for an application no older than 1 year.

To participate in a Referral flash grants, you must additionally:

* Have been successfully funded by Reset within the past year.

## How does it work?

### Collaborative flash grants

1. You apply to one of our open calls.
2. We complete our review.
3. Upon meeting the above criteria, your application will be added to a registry of others like you. 
4. You will be given access to that registry for review.
5. If you see other interesting applications, reach out to their applicant, get to know them, and come up with an exciting idea, we want to know.
6. Using a special application form only available to you while listed in the registry, you and up to 5 other applicants can submit a flash grant for our review.
7. We will complete a review.
8. If accepted, each participating applicant will be awarded.

### Referral flash grants

1. Any applicant with an approved application is empowered to make a referral. This includes collaborative flash grant awardees.
2.  After being approved, you will be given access to a referral from. 
3. Once you complete the form, we will invite the referral to complete a special application form.
4. We do a very light review. It must be within our remit and legal but we do not have to believe in it. In very very very rare cases, we will not approve.
5. When accepted, the applicant will be awarded. If they shared their application information, they would also be eligible for participating in a collaborative flash grant.

#### Conditions

* You can only do this within the first year of your approval, regardless of how long we fund you. 
* You only get to make two referrals.
* The referral can not be to directly benefit a effort we are actively supporting you for. It is totally fine if they are working closely in your space.

## How much does it give?

Each award is worth $5,000 USD per recipient.
