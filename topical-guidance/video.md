  In our open calls, we may ask you for a video to introduce yourselves, explain
  what you're doing and why, and tell us anything else you want to about the
  other key members or the project.

# The application video

## **The video should be 1 minute long and should contain nothing except you or others talking.** 

No screenshots or post-production wizardry please; we don’t want this to turn into a video making contest. If you’re going to spend time making something cool, put it into your project.

## **This is not the place to submit a demo or promotional video.**

If you have a demo for your project, there is a place in the application for that. However, we don't want to see any promotional video. Here, we want to hear how you and your partners communicate.

## **If you have more than one key partner or team member, try to have them in the video.**

If you can't be in the same room at the same time, you may want to record a video conference conversation instead.

## **Don't mark it as private or disallow embedding on YouTube.**

We won't be able to see it. Please note that because of how our system is built, YouTube's view count will not increase even though we do watch your video.

## **If you are in a country where YouTube is unavailable, you may use an alternate service, like YouKu for China.** 

If you use YouKu, you may want to set a password on your video. You can provide the password in the application.

## **Please do not recite a script written beforehand.** 

Just talk spontaneously as you would to a friend. People delivering memorized speeches \(or worse still, text read off the screen\) usually come off as stupid. Unless you’re a good enough actor to fake spontaneity, you lose more in the stilted delivery than you gain from a more polished message.

## **Please do not add any background music to your video.**

We regularly give up 10 seconds into a video because we can’t stand the random background music.

## **Watch your own video before you submit.** 

Make sure you can hear what you are saying. A significant fraction of the videos we get are inaudible. If you’re going to apply at all, you may as well apply with a video we can hear.
