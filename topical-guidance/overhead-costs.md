# Overhead costs

Awards from our open calls generally do not support standalone costs which are not directly associated with the completion of objectives or deliverables. For example, indirect costs such as operational or administrative expenses are not supported. This is in part due to contractual vehicle we primarily relay upon to award open call applications. This policy ensures that programmatic funds are focused on accomplishing our goals.

In the limited instances where Reset determines that an overhead cost would be permitted, such costs cannot be greater than 10 percent of the overall cost of the award. Projects seeking an exception bear the burden of clearly demonstrating how the lack of such an inclusion will prevent the completion of the projectâ€™s objectives.

In even more limited instances where Reset decides to give a core or general operating grant, the above does not apply.
