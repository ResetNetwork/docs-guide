# Information controls

The unchecked practice of [surveillance capitalism](../introduction/#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) has provided a [select few corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) unprecedented control on the flow of information to and from individual members of global society. 

The same corporations, governments globally, and other highest bidders misguided by profit and power are leveraging these new abilities to both create novel and augment existing information controls. Social media platform’s role as an accessory to misinformation campaigns increasing political polarization or a search platform’s irresponsible collection of data expanding unfair government surveillance are examples of information controls that challenge democratic processes and slow the spread of democracy globally.

Reset is working towards a future in which the commodification and misuse of mined personal information on a massive scale no longer come at the cost of human rights online \(digital rights\), democracy, and open societies. We believe a [quantified society](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/life-quantified-society) can exist without information controls that repress democracy participation and evolution.
