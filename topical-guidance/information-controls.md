# Information controls

Reset is working towards a future in which the commodification and misuse of mined personal information on a massive scale no longer come at the cost of human rights online \(digital rights\), democracy, and open societies. This unchecked practice of surveillance capitalism has provided a select few corporations unprecedented abilities to control the flow of information to and from our global population. The same corporations, governments globally, and other highest bidders misguided by by profit and power are levering these new abilities that we call information controls to create pioneering information controls that challenge global democracies -- such as social media platform’s role as an accessory to misinformation campaigns increasing political polarization, a search platform’s irresponsible AI expanding unfair government surveillance, or other information controls that degrade current democratic processes.
