# Information controls

The unchecked practice of [surveillance capitalism](../introduction/#our-visions-most-pressing-threat) has provided a [select few corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) unprecedented controls on the flow of information to and from individual members of global society. 

The same corporations, governments globally, and other highest bidders misguided by by profit and power are leveraging the new abilities to create new and augment existing information controls -- such as social media platform’s role as an accessory to misinformation campaigns increasing political polarization, a search platform’s irresponsible AI expanding unfair government surveillance, or other information controls that challenge democratic processes  and slow the spread of democracy globally.

Reset is working towards a future in which the commodification and misuse of mined personal information on a massive scale no longer come at the cost of human rights online \(digital rights\), democracy, and open societies.
