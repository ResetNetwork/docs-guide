# Introduction

## Sustain a platform for open exchange

Through our website and open calls, we maintain an open exchange for the network of practitioners that make up the technology-centred field fighting surveillance capitalism. In this role, our open calls facilitate and coordinate the transfer and redistribution of knowledge and resources. We seeded this work by first populating the exchange with ideas we built and supported, engaged with those also doing the same, and then opened public our open calls to engage those we do not already know.

## Knowledge sharing

Our open calls allow us to be a node within a larger network, providing us a unique holistic vantage point and an hone our ability to curate what is most important to our goals. We are in-turn relied upon and trusted for the utility of this curated technology-centric view of the surveillance capitalism landscapeâ€™s emergent properties and patterns, ecosystems, and networks within, and those nodes in the weeds. We consider this an asset of value, made available from the trust of those in the network who share with us, and have a duty to responsibly redistribute what we have back out to the field.
