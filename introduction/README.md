  Here we describe why we are doing open calls, what we hope they accomplish,
  and our collective commitment while we do this work.

# Introduction

## Sustain a platform for open exchange

Through our website and open calls, we maintain an open exchange for the network of practitioners that make up the technology-centred field fighting surveillance capitalism. In this role, our open calls facilitate and coordinate the transfer and redistribution of knowledge and resources. We seeded this work by first populating the network with ideas we have worked on and supported, engaged with those doing the same, and now maintain public our open calls to engage those we do not know.

## Knowledge sharing

Our open calls allow us to be a node within a larger network, providing us a unique holistic vantage point and an hone our ability to curate what is most important to our goals. We are in-turn relied upon and trusted for the utility of this curated technology-centric view of the surveillance capitalism landscapeâ€™s emergent properties and patterns, ecosystems, and networks within, and those nodes in the weeds. We consider this an asset of value, made available from the trust of those in the network who share with us, and have a duty to responsibly redistribute what we have back out to the field.

## Collective commitment

We ask that applicants and partners in our network strive to uphold our [principles and values](principles-values.md) as well as hold us accountable to them by providing us feedback, especially if that feedback is critical. We will do our best to make it as easy as possible to receive.
