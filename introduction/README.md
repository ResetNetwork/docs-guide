  Here we describe why we are doing open calls, what we hope they accomplish,
  and our collective commitment while we do this work.

# Introduction

## Sustain a platform for open exchange

Through our website and open calls, we maintain an open exchange for the network of practitioners that make up the technology-centred field fighting surveillance capitalism. In this role, our open calls facilitate and coordinate the transfer and redistribution of knowledge and resources. We seeded this work by first populating the network with ideas we have worked on and supported, engaged with those doing the same, and now maintain public our open calls to engage those we do not know.

## Knowledge sharing

Our open calls allow us to be a node within a larger network, providing us a unique holistic vantage point and an hone our ability to curate what is most important to our goals. We are in-turn relied upon and trusted for the utility of this curated technology-centric view of the surveillance capitalism landscapeâ€™s emergent properties and patterns, ecosystems, and networks within, and those nodes in the weeds. We consider this an asset of value, made available from the trust of those in the network who share with us, and have a duty to responsibly redistribute what we have back out to the field.

## Our vision for the future

We are conducting open calls because we believe in a globally open, inclusive equitable knowledge society with limitless opportunities for innovation, replication, and growth.

In this vision of our future, we hope our open calls ensure:

* The ability to address social challenges with technology-backed solutions is limited by the bounds of societies collective knowledge and expertise;
* Knowledge is open because it is free to use, reuse and redistribute by all -- without burdensome legal, social, economic, or technological restrictions or consequences for all --  in particular for those who have been historically and traditionally excluded, underrepresented, or repressed;
* Open data, open content, open access, and open source are universal underlying structures supporting better policy, technology, markets, and social norms; and
* A world of healthy freedom of thought, expression, speech, and without repressive surveillance capitalism is one with limitless opportunities for innovation, replication, and growth.

## Collective commitment

We ask that applicants and partners in our network share our vision and strive to uphold our [principles and values](principles-values.md) as well as hold us accountable to them by providing us feedback, especially if that feedback is critical. We will do our best to make it as easy as possible to receive.
