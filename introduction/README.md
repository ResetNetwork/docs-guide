  Here we describe why we are doing open calls, what we hope they accomplish,
  and our collective commitment while we do this work.

# Introduction

## Sustain a platform for open exchange

Through our website and open calls, we maintain an open exchange for the network of practitioners that make up the technology-centered field fighting surveillance capitalism. In this role, our open calls facilitate and coordinate the transfer and redistribution of knowledge and resources. We seeded this work by first populating the network with ideas we have worked on and supported, engaged with those doing the same, and now maintain public our open calls to engage those we do not know.

## Knowledge sharing

Our open calls allow us to be a node within a larger network, providing us a unique holistic vantage point and an hone our ability to curate what is most important to our goals. We are in-turn relied upon and trusted for the utility of this curated technology-centric view of the surveillance capitalism landscape’s emergent properties and patterns, ecosystems, and networks within, and those nodes in the weeds. We consider this an asset of value, made available from the trust of those in the network who share with us, and have a duty to responsibly redistribute what we have back out to the field.

## Strategy as an iterative design process

Our organization-wide strategy is a ongoing evolving process. The experience of operating open calls and the knowledge gained from reviewing applications is significant catalyst of change to that strategy. The two-month rhythm of our [decision process](../decision-process/#when-to-apply) provides us a fixed, regularly repeating opportunity to factor in data from applicant feedback, information from new applications, and updates from current partners. The learning of this new knowledge creates a forcing-function to refactor our open call and organization wide strategy every two months, coinciding with the previous round of processed applications.
