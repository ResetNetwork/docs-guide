  In this section of the Guide we describe how we at Reset see the world, why
  we're holding Open Calls and what we hope they will accomplish, and our
  collective commitment to applicants and partners.

# Overview

Before diving into our vision for the future \(and how we hope our Open Calls help get us there\), we first note three unique aspects of Reset that we believe will be essential to our long-term success.

## A platform for open exchange

Through our [**website**](https://www.reset.tech/) and [**Open Calls**](https://www.reset.tech/open-calls/), Reset maintains a platform for open exchange that can be utilised by practitioners in the technology-centered field who are fighting surveillance capitalism. In this role, our Open Calls help facilitate and coordinate the transfer and redistribution of knowledge and resources. We seeded this work by first populating the network with ideas we have worked on and supported, engaged with those doing the same, and now maintain public our open calls to engage those we do not know.

## Knowledge sharing

Our open calls allow us to be a node within a larger network, providing us a unique holistic vantage point and hone our ability to curate what is most important to our goals. We are in-turn relied upon and trusted for the utility of this curated technology-centric view of the surveillance capitalism landscapeâ€™s emergent properties and patterns, ecosystems, and networks within, and those nodes in the weeds. We consider this an asset of value, made available from the trust of those in the network who share with us, and have a duty to responsibly redistribute what we have back out to the field.

## Strategy as an iterative design process

Our organization-wide strategy is an ongoing evolving process. The experience of operating open calls and the knowledge gained from reviewing applications is a significant catalyst of change to that strategy. The two-month rhythm of our [decision process](../for-applicants/decision-process/#when-to-apply) provides us a fixed, regularly repeating opportunity to factor in data from applicant feedback, information from new applications, and updates from current partners. This new knowledge creates a forcing-function to refactor our open call and organization wide strategy every two months, coinciding with the previous round of processed applications.
