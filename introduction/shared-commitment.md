# Collective commitment

## Our shared commitment

We ask that all applicants and partners in our network share our vision and strive to uphold our [**Principles & values**](https://app.gitbook.com/@resetnetwork/s/guide/introduction/principles-values). In turn, we ask to be held accountable, and encourage those in our network to provide us with [**feedback**](https://guide.reset.tech/give-us-feedback) - especially if it is critical. We will do our best to make it as easy as possible to receive.
