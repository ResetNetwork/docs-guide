# Goals & objectives

## Goals

To accomplish our above stated aim, our open calls support technology-focused interventions with clear human-centered benefits for those negatively affected by surveillance capitalism. Everything we support or do ourselves first advances this and then fits within one or more of our goals, objectives, and the type of work we focus on. Starting with our goals, we strive to support efforts that:

* **Improve the** _**integrity**_ **of democracy in our digital age:** by intervening directly with governments, press, and other institutions responsible for the trust and health of current democracies;
* **Enhance digital** _**protections**_ **available to individuals:** by giving them the power to thwart surveillance capitalismâ€™s ability to pervade;
* **Raise** _**awareness**_ **on the state of surveillance capitalism:** by illuminating threats and opportunities; and,
* **Stimulate the growth of virtuous** _**alternatives**_**:** by exploring better policy creation and money making models.

## Objectives

To accomplish our goals, with our open calls we continually work to:

* **Distribute more resources:** Increase what is available and ensure it's redistributed to as many aligned partners as possible;
* **Evolve the platform:** Better facilitate the exchange of knowledge, funds, and other resources by improving and expanding our open call offerings;
* **Maintain awareness:** Create and make available open opportunities for learning and sharing back;
* **Fortify the field:** Further enable the ecosystem of people, institutions, organizations, projects, and communities to respond and persist;
* **Grow the network:** Ensure there are clear protocols to follow for healthy expansion and agency at the edges for new connections; and,
* **Protect the network:** Maintain a productive, enriching, and safe network of good-standing people and organizations who are our partners.
