# Guiding principles and values

The [Goals & Objectives](goals-objectives.md) of our open calls guide our path as we conduct open calls, they set our general direction and what our decisions point to. The following principles are the rules we abide by or standards we maintain, that govern our behaviour as we make our day-to-day decisions in the open calls. The following values help to form these principles, they are the qualities or beliefs that define our behaviour or how we conduct ourselves. Together, they form the foundation of the culture we hope create and maintain for all who participate in the open calls and become part of the Reset network. 

## Principles

* **Data privacy advances human rights:** Sustain and advance individual data privacy protections in everything we do. In the digital age, the misuse of personal information facilitates discrimination, deteriorates free expression, disrupts citizen participation in government, and many other declared human rights. We believe the best way to defend human rights today is by advancing data privacy.
* **Tell the truth, be trusted:** “Honesty is a gift we can give to others, a source of power, and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us nothing to keep track of.“ Does what we do help us become a more trusted community member?
* **We know very little:** View every situation as an opportunity to learn, practice active listening, give feedback without fear, and are more interested in learning than being right.
* **Be human-centred:** Measure the actual impact of what we do and what we support by evaluating the experience of those who are at the receiving end of the engagement. We view our work as building relationships over conducting transactions.
* **Communicate clearly:** We speak our loudest and clearest with what and how we fund when we are succinct, candid, and kind. 
* **Breadth over depth but also reach:** Always think about things in the broader sense, what broader effects it could have, while focusing on a specific challenges or solutions, not either or.
* **Assume scarcity:** Always try to stretch the resources we have, get excited when things have multiple uses, spend money like it is the last, and maintain a runway.
* **Life balance:** This is a long-term challenge and we want as many people to join and thrive in that time, so it is important to take time off, work-life balance, and being a primarily remote-only team is a large part of the solution.
* **Uphold our values:** Make all our decisions based on the following values, even if it is inconvenient.

## Values

The fund’s values are **Change, Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, and Transparency**. All our values are interlinked and work with one another to maintain and protect our culture. 

* **Change:** We believe the greatest ideas are iterative innovations: supported by healthy ecosystems that share, use, and build openly and collaboratively; built by embracing change through experimentation, reflection, and adaptation without fear of failure.
* **Collaboration:** Helping others is our priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that we are trying to achieve. 
* **Results:** We do what we promise to each other, applicants, supported projects, those who support us, our other stakeholders, and the public. We expect the same in return.
* **Efficiency:** We care about working on and supporting the right things, not doing more than needed, not duplicating work, working smarter not harder. This enables us to achieve more progress, have a greater effect, be apart of larger impacts, which makes the work we do more fulfilling.
* **Diversity:** We are committed to creating an environment where all voices feel valued, included, and are empowered to bring their perspectives to the table and have agency in solutions. Not only are we committed to taking on that challenge, but we will strive to better support underrepresented voices in the communities we support through a variety of means.
* **Transparency:** We strive to be open about as many things as possible, to share openly all possible aspects of our work, including what and how we learned and did it, with the public, and other stakeholders, in a non-competitive fashion. In this, we practice the doctrine of open philanthropy, governance, reduce the threshold for others to contribute, and to make collaboration easier.

### Hierarchy

Occasionally, values can contradict each other. For instance, transparency would dictate we publish all applications publicly the moment they are submitted, but this could jeopardize the effect and impact of the applicants work. It's useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values.

| Values |  |  | Why in this order |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Results** |  |  | _It is most important for us to focus on impact_ |
| **Change** | **Transparency** | \*\*\*\* | _We trust these values will lead to better results_ |
| **Efficiency** | **Collaboration** | **Diversity** | _These values distinguish applicants and us to others_ |

Reflecting on values in any given context is not absolute. If one thinks of values as binary or zero sum, things will not go well, it will not work. Our value hierarchy is an attempt to relieve at least some of the tension. It won't preempt every debate, but it helps. There will always be interpretation, there's always magnitude to consider, and that is welcome.

We maintain a hierarchy so that it's clear, in the end, the result matters most. For instance, we're not going to be transparent or diverse for the sake of it. We're not radical or trying to virtue signal these values. We do it because we think and see that it leads to better outcomes.

How we reinforce these values
