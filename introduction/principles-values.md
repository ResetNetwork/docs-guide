# Guiding principles and values

The aim of our open calls and its goals guide our path, they set our direction our decisions point to. The following principles are the rules we abide by or standards we maintain, that govern our behaviour as we make our day-to-day decisions in the open calls. The following values help to form these principles, they are the qualities or beliefs that define our behaviour or how we conduct ourselves. Together, they form the foundation of the culture we hope create and maintain for all who participate in the open calls and become part of the Reset network. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust these principles and values and strive always to make them better.

## Principles

* **Data privacy advances human rights:** Sustain and advance individual data privacy protections in everything we do. In the digital age, the misuse of personal information facilitates discrimination, deteriorates free expression, disrupts citizen participation in government, and many other declared human rights. We believe the best way to defend human rights today is by advancing data privacy.
* **Tell the truth, be trusted:** “Honesty is a gift we can give to others, a source of power, and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we told the truth in the past leaves us nothing to keep track of.“ Does what we do help us become a more trusted community member?
* **We know very little:** View every situation as an opportunity to learn, practice active listening, give feedback without fear, and are more interested in learning than being right.
* **Be human-centred:** Measure the actual impact of what we do and what we support by evaluating the experience of those who are at the receiving end of the engagement. We view our work as building relationships over conducting transactions.
* **Communicate clearly:** We speak our loudest and clearest with what and how we fund when we are succinct, candid, and kind. 
* **Breadth over depth / Reach:** Always think about things in the broader sense, what broader effects it could have, without focusing on a specific challenge or solution.
* **Assume scarcity:** Always try to stretch the resources we have, get excited when things have multiple uses, spend money like it is the last, and maintain a runway.
* **Life balance:** This is a long-term challenge and we want as many people to join and thrive in that time, so it is important to take time off, work-life balance, and being a primarily remote-only team is a large part of the solution.
* **Uphold our values:** Make all our decisions based on the following values, even if it is inconvenient.

## Values

The fund’s values are **Change, Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, and Transparency**. All our values are interlinked and work with one another to maintain and protect our culture. 

* **Change:** We believe the greatest ideas are iterative innovations: supported by healthy ecosystems that share, use, and build openly and collaboratively; built by embracing change through experimentation, reflection, and adaptation without fear of failure.
* **Collaboration:** Helping others is our priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that we are trying to achieve. 
* **Results:** We do what we promise to each other, applicants, supported projects, those who support us, our other stakeholders, and the public. We expect the same in return.
* **Efficiency:** We care about working on and supporting the right things, not doing more than needed, not duplicating work, working smarter not harder. This enables us to achieve more progress, have a greater effect, be apart of larger impacts, which makes the work we do more fulfilling.
* **Diversity:** We recognize the importance and challenge of creating an environment where all voices feel valued, included, and empowered to bring their perspectives to the table. Not only are we committed to taking on that challenge, but we will strive to better support underrepresented voices in the communities we support through a variety of means.
* **Transparency:** We strive to be open about as many things as possible, to share openly all possible aspects of our work, including what and how we learned and did it, with the public, and other stakeholders, in a non-competitive fashion. In this, we practice the doctrine of open philanthropy, governance, reduce the threshold for others to contribute, and to make collaboration easier.
