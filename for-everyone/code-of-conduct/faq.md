# Code of Conduct FAQ

**Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?**

We think the Reset network is awesome. If you're familiar with those already a part of the network you'll probably notice that the Code basically aligns with what we already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit.

We're doing this because the Reset network is growing quickly. This is on balance a very positive thing, but as we've grown past the point where it's possible to know everyone within the network we think it's very important to be clear about our values.

The Reset network is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to make sure everyone, new and old, experiences it too.

#### What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct? <a id="what-does-it-mean"></a>

For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text does a really good job describing the way the network already conducts itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave in the awesome way they already have.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC when in "official" Reset spaces. This code has been adopted by both the Reset core team and by the Reset council members. That means that it'll apply both in community spaces _and_ at Reset events.

In practice, this means content within our submission app, mailing lists, issue tracker, and code review tools, and "official" Reset events. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

#### What about events funded by the Django Software Foundation? <a id="dsf-events"></a>

This Code of Conduct also covers any events that the Reset funds. However, events funded by the Reset already require a code of conduct. Isn't this redundant?

No: there's a difference between the two, and they're complementary.

This Code of Conduct is all about how we interact as a network. It's about saying that the Reset network will be open, friendly, and welcoming. The core issue is about ensuring the conversations we have are productive and inviting for all.

Real-life events, however, require a bit more care. Reset wants to be sure that any events it funds have policies and procedures in place for handling harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps to protect the physical and mental security of their participants.

So Reset will require that any events it funds have some sort of anti- harassment policy in place. Reset thinks the [Ada Initiative's template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) is pretty good, but we're open to alternatives.

#### What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct? <a id="violations"></a>

Our intent is that anyone in the network can stand up for this code, and direct people who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work, or if you need more help, you can contact conduct@reset.tech. For more details please see our [Reporting Guidelines](reporting.md)

#### Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk. <a id="why-do-we-need"></a>

Sadly, not everyone knows this.

However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone was familiar with codes of conduct it would still be incumbent upon our network to publish our own. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and articulate what kind of network we want to be, and serves as a constant reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a signpost to people looking to join our network that we feel these values are important.

#### This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want! <a id="free-speech"></a>

You do -- in _your_ space. If you'd like to hang out in _our_ spaces \(as clarified above\), we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want to, for example, form a group where Reset is discussed using language inappropriate for general channels then nobody's stopping you. We respect your right to establish whatever codes of conduct you want in the spaces that belong to you. Please honor this Code of Conduct in our spaces.
